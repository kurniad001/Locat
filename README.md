# Locat
A directory of specific objects, skills and the people they belong to.

##Introduction
The plan of Locat app is to create a public marketplace network that directs people to products and services closest to their current location.

###Location Ranking
Instead of ranking what is new, Locat ranks its search by prioritizing what is nearby. This allows people to make efficient use of their local resources.

###Item/Service Based Search
When we think about getting a specific object/help needed; in most cases, we would mostly be thinking about the properties of the object itself or the help we need, rather than the brand name or person we want to get it from. Instead of looking up a specific business, Locat allows you to search directly for the specific item or service needed.
